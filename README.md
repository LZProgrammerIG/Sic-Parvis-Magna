This repository represents my Game Dev Journey.

So a bit of a backstory. When I was young, I was more inclined towards hardware 
because access to some serious firepower was a luxury and it seemed magical, while software was complicated and watching my brother code in C++, writing all those strange keywords that didn't make any sense to me at that time, didn't help either.

However, I found coding enjoyble when I had to eventually learn Python in school. Python is easy to grasp, so I quickly leanred all the basics in school. But the main interest in coding developed after seeing a bunch of snippets of GTA Online code posted by Tez2 on twitter, a dataminer, where he would explain stuff like reward system and source of bugs. Of course I couldn't understand anything at that time, but I always wanted to make games and after realising that coding is the soul of game development, a fire ignited inside me.

So on 15 April, 2023 I created my very first game - a simple Tic Tac Toe on Python using RNG to play against computer. Although it was very basic, but the pleasure it gave me was overwhelming. That day I decided to pursue a career in Game Dev. After that I decided to make Plot Four using similar logic but it was ultimately scrapped as I began experimenting with Unreal Engine. I don't know why I chose Unreal over Unity but what I knew was that I needed to learn C++ to make games in Unreal Engine.

So that's what I did next. I got myself enrolled in a C++ course by Coding Ninjas, where I learned basics as well as Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA due to my brother's recommendation). C++ has a steep learning curve and it was challenging for sure, but I completed the course without any great difficulty.

After that, inspired by One Lone Coder command prompt game engine videos, I tried to make a game playable inside the terminal itself.
